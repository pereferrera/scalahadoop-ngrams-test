This is a small experiment that uses ScalaHadoop to crunch the Google N-Grams, trying to find words whose importance boomed significantly in a period of 5 or less years.

To build it, execute "ant resolve" and then "ant". You need to resolve first in order to have scala's ant tasks in the classpath.
You can then execute it with "hadoop jar scala-test.jar". You can provide input files like the ones in http://ngrams.googlelabs.com/datasets. The file with the total counts for each year is already present in src/.

Should you find something not working as expected or should you have any doubt or question, please write to pere[at]datasalt.com
